//The dosage on her cold meds are dependent on her age and she can only take
//a limited number of tablets every few hours.
//Can you do her an absolute solid and work out how many she needs?

//under 12s can only take 1 every 4 hours
//ages 12 and over can only take 2 tablets every 4 hours
//age = Mell's age in years, lastTaken = the number of hours since she took her meds.
